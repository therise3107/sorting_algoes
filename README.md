# sorting_algoes

## Merge sort

* Uses divide and conquer strategy
* Has the lowest asymptotic complexity of O(nlogn)
* Has Space complexity of O(n)
* Divides the array around mid point and then compares the two values and merges recursively.

## Quick sort

* Uses divide and conquer strategy
* Has the asymptotic complexity of O(nlogn) in best case
* No additional space complexity, makes changes to the original array
* Uses the pivot for partitioning of array
* Three way partitioning is preffered due to closer complexity to almost nlogn.
* Places left on items less than pivot and on right greater than pivot.


I like both algorithms but merge sort is stable and faster but quick sort has more variations and can be fun to write the algo.
